# Configuring
Modmenu is pretty much necessary for this. The color is saved as a single integer under `.minecraft/config/hittable.json5` in RGB format, so editing that by yourself won't be very easy unless you know how to construct such an integer. The mod can also be enabled/disabled from the same config.

With modmenu you can use the color picker or enter the color in hexadecimal format (which is basically what every color picker will give you).
